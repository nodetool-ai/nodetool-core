    ðŸŽ¯ The Mission Control - Coordinates specialized agents to solve complex problems

    This class is the command center that orchestrates the entire agent ecosystem,

    1. Plans the approach using TaskPlanner
    2. Assigns tasks to appropriate specialized agents
    3. Tracks overall progress and dependencies
    4. Ensures the full objective is completed efficiently

    Think of it as a project manager who oversees multiple teams with different
    specialties, ensuring everyone works in harmony toward a common goal.

    - Planning with specialized research capabilities
    - Agent specialization based on task types
    - Task dependency management
    - Progress reporting and persistence

        This method is the entry point for solving a complex problem end-to-end,

        1. Creates or loads a task plan
        2. Displays the plan for transparency

        4. Assigns each task to the appropriate specialized agent

        6. Continues until completion or maximum steps reached
        7. Provides a detailed summary of results
