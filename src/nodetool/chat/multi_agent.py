    ðŸŽ¯ The Mission Control - Coordinates specialized agents to solve complex problems

    This class is the command center that orchestrates the entire agent ecosystem,
    from planning to execution. It:

    1. Plans the approach using TaskPlanner
    2. Assigns tasks to appropriate specialized agents
    3. Tracks overall progress and dependencies
    4. Ensures the full objective is completed efficiently

    Think of it as a project manager who oversees multiple teams with different
    specialties, ensuring everyone works in harmony toward a common goal.

    Features:
    - Planning with specialized research capabilities
    - Agent specialization based on task types
    - Task dependency management
    - Progress reporting and persistence

        This method is the entry point for solving a complex problem end-to-end,

        1. Creates or loads a task plan
        2. Displays the plan for transparency

        4. Assigns each task to the appropriate specialized agent

        6. Continues until completion or maximum steps reached
        7. Provides a detailed summary of results
