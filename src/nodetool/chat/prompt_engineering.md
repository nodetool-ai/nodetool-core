# Prompt Engineering Improvements for Chain of Thought Agent

This document outlines the prompt engineering improvements applied to the Chain of Thought (CoT) agent implementation in `nodetool-core/src/nodetool/chat/cot_agent.py`.

## Summary of Improvements

The following prompt engineering best practices have been implemented:

1. **Advanced Planning System Prompt**: Enhanced the task planning system with clearer guidance on breaking down complex tasks
2. **Detailed Chain of Thought Prompt**: Added explicit step-by-step reasoning instructions for complex tasks
3. **Enhanced Retrieval & Summarization Prompts**: Improved prompts for retrieval and summarization agents
4. **Explicit Reasoning Structure**: Added structured reasoning guidance in all prompts
5. **Tool Usage Reflection**: Added reflection steps after tool usage for better reasoning

## Key Pattern Implementations

### 1. Chain of Thought (CoT) Reasoning

Implemented explicit Chain of Thought reasoning in the `DETAILED_COT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, which guides the model to:

- Break down problems into clear components
- Plan the approach before executing
- Identify dependencies and prerequisites
- Execute step-by-step with clear reasoning
- Verify intermediate results
- Reconsider approaches when stuck
- Synthesize a final solution

### 2. Advanced Task Planning

Enhanced the task planning process with:

- Clear goal decomposition steps
- Task dependency mapping
- Parallel optimization techniques
- Critical path analysis
- Risk assessment

### 3. Thinking vs. Execution Modes

Implemented differentiated prompting based on the task type:

- For thinking-intensive tasks: Uses `DETAILED_COT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` with higher temperature settings
- For execution-focused tasks: Uses more direct prompts with lower temperature settings

### 4. Tool-Use Reflection

Added explicit reflection steps after tool usage:

- What information was obtained from the tool
- How the information helps with the task
- What the next logical step should be
- Identification of unexpected or problematic results

### 5. Dynamic Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Enhanced the execute method to incorporate progressive CoT prompting:

- Initial task prompt with step-by-step guidance
- Intermediate reflection prompts after tool calls
- Structured reasoning for complex tasks

## Implementation Details

### System Prompts

Four specialized system prompts have been implemented:

1. `ADVANCED_PLANNING_SYSTEM_PROMPT`: For task planning and decomposition
2. `DETAILED_COT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`: For tasks requiring deep reasoning
3. `RETRIEVAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT`: For focused information gathering
4. `SUMMARIZATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT`: For effective information synthesis

### Enhanced Execution Logic

The execution logic has been improved with:

- Dynamic prompt selection based on task type
- Intermediate reflection steps for complex reasoning
- Temperature adjustments based on task requirements
- Better context handling for long-running tasks

## Best Practices Applied

The improvements are based on the following prompt engineering best practices:

1. **Clarity and Precision**: Using clear, specific instructions in all prompts
2. **Structured Reasoning**: Breaking down complex tasks into explicit steps
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Building in reflection opportunities throughout execution
4. **Context Awareness**: Handling context effectively through summarization
5. **Parallelization Guidance**: Explicit instructions for concurrent task execution
6. **Tool Usage Optimization**: Clear guidance on when and how to use tools
7. **Step-by-Step Thinking**: Explicit guidance to show all reasoning steps

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further enhancement:

1. Implementing few-shot examples for complex reasoning patterns
2. Adding more specialized agent types for different task categories
3. Dynamic adjustment of reasoning depth based on task complexity
4. Better context management for very long-running tasks
5. Integration with external knowledge bases for enhanced reasoning
