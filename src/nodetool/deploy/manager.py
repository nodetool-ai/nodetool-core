"""
Deployment manager orchestrator for all deployment types.

This module provides a unified interface for managing deployments across
different platforms (self-hosted, RunPod, GCP). It handles:
- Change detection (comparing current vs desired state)
- Plan generation (showing what will change)
- Deployment orchestration
- State management
- Validation and error handling
