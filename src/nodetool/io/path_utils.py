    Resolve a path relative to the workspace directory.
    Handles paths starting with '/workspace/', 'workspace/', or absolute paths
    by interpreting them relative to the `workspace_dir`.

    Args:
        workspace_dir: The absolute path to the workspace directory.
        path: The path to resolve, which can be:
            - Prefixed with '/workspace/' (e.g., '/workspace/output/file.txt')
            - Prefixed with 'workspace/' (e.g., 'workspace/output/file.txt')
            - An absolute path (e.g., '/input/data.csv') - treated relative to workspace root
            - A relative path (e.g., 'output/file.txt')

    Returns:
        The absolute path in the actual filesystem.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If workspace_dir is not provided or empty.
