# NodeTool Core Documentation

Welcome to the NodeTool Core documentation! This guide will help you understand how to use NodeTool Core to build and run AI workflows.

## What is NodeTool Core?

NodeTool Core is a Python library that provides a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use way to build and run AI workflows. It uses a node-based approach, where each node represents a specific operation, and nodes are connected together to form a workflow.
