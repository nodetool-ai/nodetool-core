# NodeTool Core Documentation

Welcome to the NodeTool Core documentation! This guide will help you understand how to use NodeTool Core to build and
run AI workflows.

## What is NodeTool Core?

NodeTool Core is a Python library that provides a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use way to build and run AI workflows.
It uses a node-based approach, where each node represents a specific operation, and nodes are connected together to form
a workflow.

## Main Features

NodeTool Core provides a wide range of features:

- **Node-based workflow system** - Build complex workflows by connecting simple nodes
- **Multi-provider AI support** - Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and more
- **Agent system** - Create intelligent agents with specialized capabilities
- **DSL (Domain-Specific Language)** - Create workflows with a Python-based DSL
- **High-performance execution engine** - Run workflows efficiently on CPU or GPU
- **Workflow streaming API** - Get real-time updates on workflow progress
