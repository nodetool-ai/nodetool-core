# Docker Testing (moved)

**Audience:** Contributors running Docker-backed tests.  
**What you will learn:** Where tests and commands are documented.

Testing notes are consolidated under [execution-strategies](execution-strategies.md#testing). Run `pytest -q tests/workflows/test_docker_job_execution.py` and `tests/workflows/test_docker_runners_e2e.py` for Docker coverage.
