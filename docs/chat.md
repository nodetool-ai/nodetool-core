The chat module provides an interactive command line interface and utilities for conversational AI. It supports multiple
providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and Ollama, and integrates various tools that the assistant can call during a
chat session.

Main features:

- Interactive CLI with history and auto-completion
- Sandboxed workspace for file operations
- Support for provider specific models
- Optional agent mode for tool-augmented conversations

For details see the [chat README](../src/nodetool/chat/README.md) and the [Chat CLI guide](chat-cli.md).
