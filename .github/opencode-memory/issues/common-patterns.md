## Common Patterns

Document recurring patterns here as they emerge:

- **Type Annotation Issues**: Ensure all new code includes proper type hints
- **Async/Await Patterns**: Don't mix blocking and async code inappropriately
- **Test Environment**: Tests automatically use `ENV=test` - don't override unnecessarily
