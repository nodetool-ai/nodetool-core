# Feature Inventory

- **Workflow Engine**: Executes async workflows in Python
- **Node System**: Typed nodes with media refs and processing context
- **Agent Framework**: LLM-backed planning and tool execution
- **API Server**: FastAPI HTTP/WebSocket services
- **Storage Layer**: Pluggable persistence backends
- **Async Utilities**: `AsyncSemaphore` and `gather_with_concurrency` for async concurrency control
- **Async Iterators**: `AsyncByteStream` for async byte sequence iteration in chunks, plus `async_take`, `async_slice`, `async_first`, `async_list`, `async_map`, `async_merge`, `async_filter`, `async_flat_map`, and `async_reduce` utilities for async iterable manipulation
- **Retry Utilities**: `retry_with_exponential_backoff` and `RetryPolicy` for handling transient failures
- **Timeout Utilities**: `timeout`, `with_timeout`, `TimeoutPolicy`, and `TimeoutContext` for async timeout control
- **Batching Utilities**: `batched_async_iterable` and `process_in_batches` for async batch processing
- **Rate Limiting**: `AsyncTokenBucket` and `AsyncRateLimiter` for controlling operation rates (token bucket algorithm)
- **Circuit Breaker**: `CircuitBreaker`, `MultiCircuitBreaker`, and `CircuitBreakerConfig` for preventing cascading failures in distributed systems
- **Async Lock**: `AsyncLock` for exclusive resource access with timeout support, complementing `AsyncSemaphore`
- **Task Group Management**: `AsyncTaskGroup` for managing groups of related async tasks with spawn, run, cancel, and result collection
- **Priority Queue**: `AsyncPriorityQueue` for priority-based async task scheduling with configurable max size and timeout support
- **Async Event**: `AsyncEvent` for inter-task signaling with one-shot and auto-reset modes, supports value passing and predicate-based waiting
- **Async Barrier**: `AsyncBarrier` for synchronizing multiple coroutines at a synchronization point, useful for phased concurrent operations
- **Async Condition**: `AsyncCondition` for condition variables allowing tasks to wait until notified by another task, with lock-based coordination to prevent race conditions
- **Async Reader-Writer Lock**: `AsyncReaderWriterLock` for multiple concurrent readers with exclusive writer access, using writer-preference semantics to prevent starvation
- **Async Channel**: `AsyncChannel` for producer-consumer patterns with send/receive/close operations, async iteration, and fan-in/fan-out utilities for channel composition
- **Debounce & Throttle**: `AsyncDebounce`, `AsyncThrottle`, and `AdaptiveThrottle` for controlling async function execution frequency, useful for rate limiting and preventing excessive API calls
- **Async Cache**: `AsyncCache` for in-memory caching with TTL support, automatic expiration, background cleanup, max size enforcement, and cache statistics tracking
