            # Task: Proactive Code Quality Improvement
            
            ## Important Context
            You are working on **nodetool-core**, a Python 3.11+ AI workflow engine with async-first architecture.
            
            Before starting work:
            1. Read `.github/opencode-memory/repository-context.md` for project structure and conventions
            2. Check `.github/opencode-memory/common-issues.md` for patterns to look for
            3. Review `.github/opencode-memory/insights.md` for architectural patterns
            
            ## Your Task
            Scan the codebase for code quality issues and bad practices. Look for:
            
            ### Code Quality Issues
            - **Type Safety**: Missing type hints in new/changed code
            - **Error Handling**: Bare except clauses, missing error context
            - **Async Patterns**: Blocking calls in async functions, missing await keywords
            - **Resource Management**: Missing context managers for files/connections
            - **Security**: Hardcoded secrets, SQL injection risks, XSS vulnerabilities
            - **Performance**: Inefficient loops, unnecessary copying, memory leaks
            
            ### Code Smells
            - Dead code or unused imports
            - Overly complex functions (consider refactoring if >50 lines)
            - Duplicate code that could be extracted
            - Inconsistent naming or style
            - Missing docstrings for public APIs
            - TODO/FIXME comments that should be addressed
            
            ### Testing Gaps
            - New features without tests
            - Low coverage areas that are critical
            - Brittle tests with hard dependencies
            - Missing edge case coverage
            
            ## Guidelines for Improvements
            
            ### Code Quality Standards
            - **Python Style**: Follow Black formatting, use type hints, prefer f-strings
            - **Naming**: `snake_case` for functions, `PascalCase` for classes, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
            - **Async Patterns**: Prefer async/await, avoid blocking calls in async code
            - **Architecture**: Follow Dependency Injection, Factory, Strategy, and Observer patterns
            
            ### Making Changes
            - ✅ Make **minimal, focused changes** - one coherent improvement per PR
            - ✅ Fix only what you identify as a clear issue
            - ✅ Ensure improvements don't break existing functionality
            - ✅ Add tests if fixing bugs or adding features
            - ✅ Follow Conventional Commits: `refactor:`, `fix:`, `feat:`, `test:`, etc.
            - ❌ Don't refactor working code just for style preferences
            - ❌ Don't remove or modify working tests
            - ❌ Don't make multiple unrelated changes in one PR
            - ❌ Don't introduce new dependencies without strong justification
            
            ### Validation Requirements
            ALL of these must pass before submitting:
            ```bash
            make lint      # ruff check .
            make test      # pytest -q
            make typecheck # basedpyright
            ```
            
            ### Memory System
            - Check `.github/opencode-memory/common-issues.md` before fixing recurring issues
            - Document new patterns discovered in `.github/opencode-memory/insights.md`
            - Update common issues with solutions to non-trivial problems
            
            ## PR Requirements
            - **Title**: Clear, concise description following Conventional Commits
            - **Description**: Explain what issue you found, why it's a problem, and how you fixed it
            - **Scope**: One coherent improvement - don't mix multiple unrelated fixes
            - **Testing**: Describe how you verified the fix works
            - **Breaking Changes**: Call out any API or behavior changes
            
            ## Success Criteria
            - Identified a genuine code quality issue or bad practice
            - Fixed it with minimal, surgical changes
            - All validation commands pass
            - PR is focused and coherent
            - Changes improve code quality without breaking functionality
            
            ## Environment Notes
            - Dependencies are already installed via `uv sync --all-extras --dev`
            - System dependencies (ffmpeg, libgl1, libglib2.0-0) are pre-installed
            - You're running in GitHub CI with Python 3.11 (not conda)
            - Tests use `ENV=test` with in-memory storage automatically
