            # Task: Automated Quality Assurance
            
            ## Important Context
            You are working on **nodetool-core**, a Python 3.11+ AI workflow engine with async-first architecture.
            
            Before starting work:
            1. Read `.github/opencode-memory/repository-context.md` for project structure and conventions
            2. Check `.github/opencode-memory/common-issues.md` for known problems
            3. Review `.github/opencode-memory/insights.md` for architectural guidance
            
            ## Your Task
            Run the validation commands and fix any issues:
            
            ```bash
            make lint      # Uses ruff for linting
            make test      # Runs pytest
            make typecheck # Runs basedpyright
            ```
            
            ## Guidelines for Fixes
            
            ### Code Quality Standards
            - **Python Style**: Follow Black formatting, use type hints, prefer f-strings
            - **Naming**: `snake_case` for functions, `PascalCase` for classes, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
            - **Async Patterns**: Prefer async/await, avoid blocking calls in async code
            - **Imports**: Standard library → third-party → local, keep organized
            
            ### Testing Requirements
            - Tests are in `tests/` mirroring `src/` structure
            - Test files: `test_*.py`, functions: `test_*`, classes: `Test*`
            - Tests use `ENV=test` with in-memory storage automatically
            - Don't remove or modify unrelated tests
            
            ### Making Changes
            - ✅ Make **minimal, surgical changes** - only fix what's broken
            - ✅ Keep PRs small and focused on one issue type
            - ✅ Follow Conventional Commits: `fix:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, etc.
            - ✅ Ensure ALL validation commands pass before submitting
            - ❌ Don't make unrelated improvements or refactoring
            - ❌ Don't modify working code unless fixing a specific issue
            
            ### Memory System
            After solving non-trivial issues:
            - Document the problem and solution in `.github/opencode-memory/common-issues.md`
            - Record important patterns in `.github/opencode-memory/insights.md`
            
            ## Success Criteria
            - All three commands (`make lint`, `make test`, `make typecheck`) pass cleanly
            - Changes are minimal and directly address the issues
            - PR description clearly explains what was fixed and why
            - Commit messages follow Conventional Commits format
            
            ## Environment Notes
            - Dependencies are already installed via `uv sync --all-extras --dev`
            - System dependencies (ffmpeg, libgl1, libglib2.0-0) are pre-installed
            - You're running in GitHub CI with Python 3.11 (not conda)
