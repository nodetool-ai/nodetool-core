# Nodetool Async Docker Reverse Proxy Configuration
#
# This configuration file defines the global settings and services
# managed by the reverse proxy.
#
# For more information, see: docs/PROXY.md

global:
  # Domain name for TLS certificates (required)
  domain: "example.com"

  # Email address for Let's Encrypt notifications (required)
  email: "admin@example.com"

  # Bearer token for authentication (required)
  # Use a strong, randomly generated token (32+ characters)
  # Example: openssl rand -hex 32
  bearer_token: "your-secure-bearer-token-here-change-this"

  # Idle timeout in seconds before stopping unused containers (default: 300)
  # Containers will be stopped if they haven't been accessed for this duration
  idle_timeout: 300

  # HTTP port for ACME HTTP-01 challenge validation (default: 80)
  # Used only during Let's Encrypt certificate issuance/renewal
  listen_http: 80

  # HTTPS port for proxied traffic (default: 443)
  listen_https: 443

  # Path to ACME challenge directory (required for Let's Encrypt)
  # Certbot will write challenge tokens here
  acme_webroot: "/var/www/acme"

  # Path to TLS certificate file (optional, only needed for HTTPS)
  # Example: /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem
  tls_certfile: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem"

  # Path to TLS private key file (optional, only needed for HTTPS)
  # Example: /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem
  tls_keyfile: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem"

  # Logging level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR (default: INFO)
  log_level: "INFO"

# Services managed by the proxy
# Each service defines a Docker container to manage
services:
  # Example 1: Simple web application
  # All containers must listen on port 7777 internally
  - name: "web-app"
    # URL path prefix for routing to this service
    path: "/web"
    # Docker image name (with optional tag)
    # Container must expose port 7777
    image: "nginx:latest"
    # Host port for the container (optional)
    # If omitted, Docker will assign a random ephemeral port
    # host_port: 18000

  # Example 2: API service with environment variables
  - name: "api-server"
    path: "/api"
    image: "myregistry/api-service:v1.0.0"
    host_port: 15000
    # Environment variables passed to the container
    environment:
      DEBUG: "false"
      LOG_LEVEL: "info"
      DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://localhost/mydb"

  # Example 3: WebSocket service with resource limits
  - name: "websocket-handler"
    path: "/ws"
    image: "ws-server:latest"
    # Memory limit for the container (e.g., "512m", "1g", "2g")
    mem_limit: "1g"
    # CPU limit (e.g., 0.5 means 50% of one CPU, 2.0 means 2 CPUs)
    cpus: 1.0
    environment:
      WS_WORKERS: "4"

  # Example 4: Application with volume mounts
  # - name: "data-service"
  #   path: "/data"
  #   image: "data-processor:latest"
  #   host_port: 18080
  #   # Volume mounts (host:container format)
  #   volumes:
  #     /data/input: /app/input
  #     /data/output: /app/output

  # Example 5: Root path service (catch-all)
  # - name: "root-service"
  #   path: "/"
  #   image: "default-app:latest"

# Notes:
#
# 1. Internal Port:
#    - All containers must listen on port 7777 internally
#    - This is a fixed constraint; services cannot use other ports
#    - Configure your Docker images to expose port 7777
#
# 2. Path Matching:
#    - Routes use longest-prefix matching
#    - /api will match /api, /api/users, /api/users/123, etc.
#    - Root path "/" will match anything not matched by other paths
#
# 3. Port Configuration:
#    - host_port is optional; omit for automatic port assignment
#    - Use fixed ports for predictability and monitoring
#    - Ensure no port conflicts between services
#
# 4. Environment Variables:
#    - Values must be strings (quote numbers: "8080" not 8080)
#    - Sensitive values can use environment variable expansion:
#      DATABASE_PASSWORD: "${DB_PASSWORD}"
#
# 5. Docker Images:
#    - Use specific tags, not "latest" for production
#    - Ensure images are available (pulled from registry or local)
#    - Images must be configured to listen on port 7777
#
# 6. Idle Timeout:
#    - Global idle_timeout applies to all services
#    - Shorter timeout: more aggressive resource cleanup
#    - Longer timeout: faster response when accessed
#
# 7. TLS Certificates:
#    - Obtain initial certificate with certbot:
#      sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/acme -d example.com
#    - Set tls_certfile and tls_keyfile paths
#    - Renewal happens automatically via cron
#
# 8. Bearer Token:
#    - Required for authentication on protected endpoints
#    - Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
#    - Keep secure; never commit to version control
#    - Can be overridden with PROXY_GLOBAL_BEARER_TOKEN env var
